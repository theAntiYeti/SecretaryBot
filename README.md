##Running the program
Unzip the config zip and add your bot's cid and token to connection.yaml,
add admin and user group id's to permissions.yaml as you see fit and 
add test bots and configure request.yaml as you see fit.
Run the program by entering the sources folder and running main.rb.

##Licence
I like the GNU GPLv3, if you are using a free chat client and believe that others should pay you
for features you did not write, on a platform you did not write then you don't deserve to use it.
Otherwise go nuts.
